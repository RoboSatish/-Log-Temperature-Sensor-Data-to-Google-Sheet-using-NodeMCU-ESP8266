There are many IoT clouds available to store and monitor the data from various sensors. With increasing popularity of IoT, more number of sensors are used every day and these sensors produce anonymous data which are useful to control other devices on the IoT network. These data can be studied further and used to modify design or improve the system performance. The Applications of Data Logging is vast and can be applied in Research Centres, Scientific Labs, Operation Theatres, Patient Monitoring System and many more.
